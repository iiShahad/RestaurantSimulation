        Steps:
        1. The loop continues until either `endWaiter` is true or the `readyOrderBuffer` is empty.
        - This ensures that the Waiter works until the end of their shift or until all orders have been served.
    
        2. Acquire the `mutex` lock to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared `readyOrderBuffer`.
        - This prevents other threads from modifying the `redyOrderBuffer` concurrently, ensuring thread safety.
    
        3. Check if the `readyOrderBuffer` is empty:
        - If it is empty, release the `mutex` and continue to the next iteration of the loop (waiting for new redyOrders).
    
        4. If the buffer is not empty, remove an order from the `readyOrderBuffer` and store it in `orderMeal`.//////may be changeeeeeeeeee
        - The Chef retrieves an order to prepare, and the orderâ€™s details are logged.
    
        5. After releasing the mutex, simulate the time taken to serve the meal by calling `Thread.sleep()` with only one minute.
        - This models the time it takes the Waiter to serve the meal.
    
        6. Once the meal is served, log the completion, and mark the order as served by calling `orderMeal.markOrderServed(this.id)`.
        - This notifies that the meal is ready for the customer.
    
        7. In the `finally` block, check if the `mutex` lock has been acquired and ensure it is released if necessary, avoiding a deadlock.
